      Data Cleaning & Transformation To begin the Superstore Sales Analysis
      project, I performed thorough data cleaning and transformation to ensure
      the dataset was analysis-ready. This involved identifying and handling
      missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing date formats, and
      converting data types where necessary. I also created calculated columns
      such as order year, month, and profit margin to enhance analytical depth.
      Shipping delays and return status were flagged using conditional logic to
      support downstream diagnostic analysis. These transformations provided a
      clean and structured foundation for building a robust data model.

      Data Modelling Using Power BI, I designed a star schema that included
      multiple dimension tables—such as Customers, Products, Regions, Shipping
      Modes, and Calendar—linked to a central FactSales table. This dimensional
      modeling approach improved query performance and supported flexible
      slicing and dicing across multiple metrics. Relationships were established
      using primary and foreign keys, and appropriate cardinality was enforced.
      Measures were created using DAX for KPIs such as Total Sales, Total
      Profit, AOV, and Profit Margin. The model was optimized with hierarchies
      and column indexing to facilitate seamless navigation and aggregation.

      Data Visualization & Insights I developed an interactive dashboard to
      answer both descriptive and diagnostic business questions. KPI cards were
      used for high-level metrics such as Total Sales, Profit, Orders, Customer
      Count, AOV, and Profit Margin, often with sparklines to show trends.
      Visuals included bar charts for top products and sales by sub-category,
      filled maps for regional performance, stacked charts for shipping costs by
      mode, and gauges for margin tracking. For diagnostics, I built visuals to
      highlight loss-making products, regions with negative profits, and return
      rates by category. Drill-through filters allowed deeper exploration into
      customer segment profitability and the impact of shipping delays on
      financial outcomes. This BI solution empowered stakeholders to make
      informed, data-driven decisions across sales, marketing, and logistics
      functions.
